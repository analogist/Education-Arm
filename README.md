# Education-Arm
An inverse kinematics implementation of the OWI Robotic Arm with closed-loop sensing for education.

Constructed from the [OWI Robotic Arm](http://www.owirobots.com/store/index.php) with additional potentiometers for closed-loop feedback. Contains forward kinematics with joint-angle go-to capabilities, and a two-linkage inverse kinematics implementation that allows for limited Cartesian go-to ability.
